Image Recognition Conversational Chatbot
This repository contains the code and resources for an Image Recognition Conversational Chatbot that uses a pretrained LLaMA model from Hugging Face to recognize objects in images and provide insightful, interactive responses based on the detected content.

Project Overview:
Our solution leverages deep learning and natural language processing to:

Recognize Objects in Images: Given an image or its URL, the model identifies objects and provides accurate descriptions.
Answer Questions About the Image: An integrated chatbot offers relevant responses to questions posed by the user, such as identifying species, understanding the context, or providing details about the content.
Key Features:
Pretrained LLaMA Model: Utilizes a state-of-the-art pretrained model from Hugging Face for high-accuracy image recognition.
Image URL Support: Accepts both direct image uploads and image URLs for analysis.
Interactive Chatbot: Engages users with contextual information and answers about the image content.
Multi-Purpose Use: Suitable for applications in education, e-commerce, accessibility, content creation, and more.
Benefits:
Enhanced Accessibility: Supports visually impaired users by describing image content.
Educational Tool: Provides an interactive learning experience by answering questions about various objects and scenes.
Business Application: Integrates with platforms to offer detailed product insights and customer support.
Technologies Used:
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
Natural Language Processing: Hugging Face Transformers
Frontend Development: Streamlit for a user-friendly interface
